# BACKGROUND AND SCOPE

Business data has been around – since the dawn of business. The earliest days of business data saw data sitting in handwritten ledgers, then in files in filing cabinets, then floppy disks, and then as storage got progressively cheaper, on solid-state drives, and highly-portable media. Old software from past decades has found itself lagging behind the progress made in storage – both in speed and affordability, and as a result, many such applications work only with stand-alone, unwieldy databases, with very little interaction with the outside world. This stands true for businesses of all shapes and sizes – even the largest corporations in the world, which carry an ongoing &quot;legacy cost&quot; in their operations. There are a few organizations like Procter and Gamble (which was a subject of a case study in this course) that have demonstrated an ability to break free from those shackles and become a data-driven company, but by far and large, such instances are few and far between. On top of that, if one considers social media alone, even large corporations can struggle with finding ways to cope with the impact, let alone find ways to use it effectively to improve services or target improvedprofitability.

In comes the Small and Midsize Business (SMB) segment. Gartner defines[1] – &quot;A **small and midsize business (SMB)** is a business which, due to its size, has different IT requirements—and often faces different IT challenges—than do large enterprises, and whose IT resources (usually budget and staff) are often highly constrained. For the purposes of its research, Gartner defines SMBs by the number of employees and annual revenue they have. The attribute used most often is number of employees; small businesses are usually defined as organizations with fewer than 100 employees; midsize enterprises are those organizations with 100 to 999 employees. The second most popular attribute used to define the SMB market is annual revenue: small business is usually defined as organizations with less than $50 million in annual revenue; midsize enterprise is defined as organizations that make more than $50 million, but less than $1 billion in annualrevenue.&quot;

This paper is meant to serve as a treatise on Big Data and Analytics, as applied to SMBs. The intended audience (besides course reviewers and instructors) is SMB owners, who may be seeking an answer to questions like &quot;What is this Big Data thing I keep hearing about?&quot;, or &quot;What can technology and data do for me?&quot;. While some of the points covered will be general in nature, specific examples (from web research) may be provided. Please do note that, for the sake of simplicity and given SMB scope, the terms &quot;Big Data&quot; and &quot;Analytics&quot; have been used interchangeably. In conjunction with this course, some examples from some active consulting work done with 3 separate SMBs will be provided where applicable, with those companies being:

- A food brokeragecompany
- An asset recoverycompany
- A multi-disciplinary health and wellnessclinic

# BIG DATA – THE PROMISED LAND

Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or other certain advanced methods to extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. Accuracy in big data may lead to more confident decision making, and in turn, better decisions can mean greater operational efficiency, cost reduction and reduced risk[2]. As an SMB owner – especially a profitable one – one might ask, &quot;I am doing well as it is – why should I change anything?&quot;. The answer could very well be, &quot;You don&#39;t have to&quot;, but it&#39;s hard to surmise, especially in an ultra-competitive global economy, that you have optimized your operations, manufacturing, staffing and service model to a point that you have obtained optimum efficiency and maximized profits, and you are prepared to react to changing market conditions. You may very well be in a position where you can do all this, but without data-driven decision making, you cannot have the ability to change course and react to changes IN A TIMELY FASHION, let alone forecast what you should be preparing for in the coming days, weeks, and months. Below are 3 real analytics implementations that demonstrate the value derived from the initiative (sourced from [4]).

## Twiddy &amp; company realtors, Duck, North Carolina

Many travelers find vacation rentals through Twiddy &amp; Company, a family-owned local enterprise that manages 998 homes on the islands on the South Carolina coast, whether they are simple cottages or 24-bedroom beachfront mansions. Twiddy&#39;s dual challenge is to satisfy guests while ensuring homeowners rent their properties as profitably as possible. Like many companies, Twiddy had amassed years of operational data inside spreadsheets-where it all was buried, and there was no indication of informed decision-making.

Twiddy settled on SAS&#39;s business analytics tools, which distilled the company&#39;s spreadsheets into a customizable format the company could share with homeowners and contractors. Before, Twiddy could tell homeowners the dates when their property was available to rent. Now, the company can offer pricing recommendations pinpointed down to the week, on the basis of market conditions, seasonal trends, and the size and location of a home, among other criteria. Since the company began making such recommendations, overall bookings have increased, and more homeowners recommend Twiddy as a property manager. The inventory Twiddy manages has increased more than 10 percent over the past three years. Twiddy also cut costs 15 percent by comparing each contractor&#39;s maintenance charges against the average of its 1,200 other vendors, identifying and eliminating invoice processing errors, and automating service schedules. Those savings alone freed up $50,000 in the company&#39;s budget over the past two years. Not bad for an initial investment of $40,000. Twiddy hoped its Big Data spending would pay for itself in three years. The company met that goal in YearOne!!

## Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium Tacoma, Washington

Every business has gremlins, and for the Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium, the weather had long been the peskiest. The Pacific Northwest&#39;s wild weather fluctuations often make a mockery of any forecast, which means predicting zoo attendance-and therefore staffing-is difficult. For years, Point Defiance used standard weather reports, with mixed results, and that wasn&#39;t good enough. Through its analytics effort, Point Defiance parsed its historical attendance records against years of detailed local climate data collected by the National Weather Service. This led to new insights that helped the zoo anticipate with surprising precision how many customers would show up on a given weekend. That in turn helped the zoo determine, down to the hour, how many employees should be staffing front gates, carousels, and other positions on peak days.

Some managers were skeptical when the data was put to the first big test on Memorial Day weekend in 2013. Typical for the Northwest, it rained on two of the three days, and the temperature never rose above 62. But the predicted attendance was within 200 people-out of several thousand, and staffing had been adjusted accordingly, a crucial flexibility for a zoo that employs 85 to 120 people, depending on how many customers are expected. For Memorial Day 2014, the prediction was even more accurate: The zoo&#39;s projections were within 113 of actual attendance. And a closer look at the data enabled Point Defiance to boost membership 13 percent in the first quarter of 2014 by targeting discount campaigns to the Zip codes of its most frequent guests. For a minimal investment of less than $4,000, $60,000 worth of memberships were sold. Through similar efforts in the web channel, the zoo&#39;s online ticket sales have risen 771 percent over the past two years, and overall ticket purchases have set records for two consecutive years.

## Carvana, Phoenix

Carvana, a Phoenix-based online car marketplace launched in 2013, saw in Big Data multiple opportunities to better consumers&#39; experience and its business. Well before its launch, the company contacted Kaggle, an online community of data scientists who compete and collaborate to solve Big Data challenges submitted by companies such as Merck and Facebook. Carvana wanted a better way to predict if cars purchased at auction would be lemons-&quot;kicks,&quot; in used-car parlance-and it anted up $10,000 in prizes for the best solutions.

A system emerged that kicked the kicks and let Carvana make shrewder bids at auctions. Thanks to the winners of Carvana&#39;s Kaggle competition as well as data gleaned from other analytics about regional customer preferences and model availabilities, Carvana found it could sidestep lemons and buy better cars &quot;for $500 below what similar cars would sell for.&quot; That edge is helping Carvana meet its goal of offering its customers an average

$1,500 discount from market prices.

Carvana also worked with its data-expert staff members to mine customer data and reduce the risk in its financing business. Although many car dealerships simply look up a buyer&#39;s credit score, Carvana scans hundreds of variables across several databases-including full credit reports from multiple companies and searches of the LexisNexis legal and news databases-to predict the likelihood of defaults, better tailor interest rates for individual customers, and weed out suspect buyers. The result is &quot;meaningfully&quot; fewer defaults and not one car stolen through fraud !

These three success stories hopefully have provided a glimpse into what is possible, and that too, without a huge investment. The following section in this paper will address some of the basic challenges and considerations to be taken into account, before an SMB can contemplate diving head-first into analytics.

# BIG CORPORATIONS vs. SMALL-TO-MID-SIZED BUSINESSES

The reality is, the economics of big data is squeezing SMBs out of the equation[3]. Both database technology and the people with the right skill sets are expensive. Data is the oil of the 21st century, but small businesses can&#39;t compete on analytics against better funded competitors. Cloud vendors allow small businesses to start small and affordable, but tier up to huge invoices when data volumes grow. Everyone is swimming in data, and SMBs and startups can&#39;t afford to scale these analytics technologies as they (and their data) grow.

According to a recent study by IDC, the digital universe – the data we create and copy annually – is doubling in size every two years, and by 2020 it will reach 44 zettabytes, or 44 trillion gigabytes. The study also shows that the percentage of useful data that delivers real business value will continue to grow from 22 percent to 37 percent by 2020. This surge in data will create more opportunity for businesses to extract real value from data sets and make the best business and competitive decisions possible – but only if they can afford the people and technologies. Small business, startups, and entrepreneurs lack the big budgets and massive computing clusters that larger corporations have, making it more difficult for them to target the right data sets and extract value from their data in the most efficient waypossible.

But fear not – the new wave of NoSQL and open-source databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra) have the answer. These databases provide a cheaper alternative, and are well-suited for an organization of a smaller size. Besides, these databases are more scalable (easier to expand as your business grows), and they are less rigid when it comes to storing data, or making changes as your business adapts to new offerings or changing market conditions. They can hold large volumes of data (structured or unstructured), changes can be done quicker, and the architecture is built to enablescaling.

The main point being stressed here is that you do not necessarily have to get a server stack, implement a large database, and start accumulating data, and then say &quot;What do we do now ?&quot;. Larger amounts of data is NOT going to help an SMB be more profitable or competitive – in fact, even most large corporations are generally gathering data, at times don&#39;t know what to do with it all, and other pressing items like regulatory and compliance- related functions are always deemed more important. SMBs have less of that to deal with, and can in fact be more agile when it comes to deploying systems of a size appropriate to the size and functionality of the company. At the end of the day, do you understand your business? Are you asking the right questions? This is what we will cover in the next section.

# UNDERSTANDING THE BUSINESS

As stated in a previous section, three separate SMBs were engaged for this exercise:

- A food brokeragecompany
- An asset recoverycompany
- A multi-disciplinary health and wellnessclinic

For each of them, the conversation started with &quot;What do you do?&quot;, &quot;How do you make money?&quot;, and &quot;What are your challenges&quot; ? As the conversation evolved, it went from a one-line answer, to a detailed description which then provided insight into all the various variables that might affect profitability. Those variables (bolded) were then used to drive questions, leading to &quot;Ummm&quot; or &quot;A ha&quot; moments. Below is what transpired.

## The food brokerage company

Went from _ **&quot;We are food brokers&quot;** _

TO

We are a grocery **brokerage** firm based in **Ontario**. Our purpose is to seek out **new products** from suppliers and manufacturers, and facilitate **product placement** on store shelves of **major food chains** , like Loblaw and Sobey&#39;s. We work on a **commission** basis, and we get compensated based on the **number of product SKUs** purchased by the grocery stores, and also by the **net sales** of these products in the grocery stores. We are expected to **report** progress **weekly** to both **product manufacturers** , and the grocery **retailers** , and **monitor** and suggest ways to **increase product sales** and **market penetration**. However, our insight is mainly **limited** to product sales numbers from the **individual stores** , and we do not have any information on **customers** or **demographics**. Some of that information is generally extrapolated from the **location** of the stores. We strive to maintain our competitive edge over other grocery brokers by continually offering **new products** that might appeal to shoppers, based on **active feedback** received from **field agents** that **visit stores** and **monitor sales** and product placement **scenarios**.

Here are some of the questions that were raised as a result (subset presented for brevity) :

- Why are you limited to only major food chains?
- Do the net sales take into account seasonal swings, and are your commissions also adjusted for those changes?
- Are you able to run predictive models to predict sales, instead of always reporting what already happened ?
- Can you get customer information from the stores and increase your insight?
- When offering new products, do you rollout to all stores at the same time, or have a phased approach?

## The asset recovery company

Went from _ **&quot;We are in the repo business&quot;** _

TO

We are an **asset** recovery firm based in **Ontario**. Our purpose is to recover assets that have been loaned out by **banks** and other **lenders** , **when the debtors have defaulted** on their payments. We generally receive repossession orders from the lending facilities, alongwith specifics for the asset, for instance, **amount owed** , **debtor information** , and any other **information** that might help track down the asset. We charge a **set base amount** , and then the rest of the charges depend on the action taken, whether that results in a **full repossession** of the asset, or a set **redemption** amount is settled in trust. Other charges like **towing** and **storage** are also **passed on** to the client, and settled as a part of the overall **invoice**. A lot of this work is performed by &quot; **field agents**&quot; that are generally assigned based on **geographical information** and **proximity** of the agent to the actual specified asset location. The field agents are **compensated** mainly on a per asset basis, and sometimes other billing items like **mileage** etc. are also paid out. We strive to maintain our competitive edge over other asset recovery firms by providing the **shortest turnaround times** possible - from the time the asset recovery request comes in, to the time the asset is confirmed to have been recovered and placed in a secure facility. We do, however, face a challenge with certain cases that are deemed to be **fraudulent** , and they end up costing a lot of time and effort, with the compensation being **grossly disproportionate**. We are expanding now, with the current challenge being getting agents to work on cases **outside the GTA**.

Here are some of the questions that were raised as a result (subset presented for brevity) :

- Is there a way for you to predict the likelihood of debtors defaulting, instead of being reactive?
- How accurate is the information given to you, and what is the cost of inaccurate information (like a wrong address?)
- Is there an option to re-negotiate auxiliary charges, like towing and storage?
- How timely and accurate is the information from the field agents, and does it impact overall turnaround times?
- How can you get a better handle on fraud prediction, resulting in lesser time spent out in the field?

## The multi-disciplinary health and wellness clinic

Went from _ **&quot;We run a chiro/physio/massage clinic&quot;** _

TO

We are a **multi-disciplinary** health and wellness clinic. We offer **chiropractic, physiotherapy, massage and nutrition counseling services** in the **east end** of Toronto, with a majority of our patients based within a **20-km radius**.Thisisamaturepractice,well-knownandrespectedthroughouttheregion,andthereforealotofnew

business is generated through **referrals from existing patients** , or from **MDs** in the surrounding areas. We operate

  1. **days** a week, providing **almost concurrent** coverage in all of our disciplines. We do have a **web presence** and a **Facebook** page, and there is a small marketing budget as well. We strive to maintain our competitive edge over other clinics in the area by being one of the very few multi-disciplinary clinics in the area providing care. It is very common for our practitioners to **refer patients across disciplines** , for example, suggesting a patient to get massage therapy in conjunction with chiropractic care, in an effort to get better results. Results are generally measured by **patient feedback** and **discharge rates**. The **compensation models** differ from one discipline to the other. Some practitioners are paid based on a **percentage of the revenue** they generate, with the withheld amount going to the clinic coffers to pay for the administrative staff covering the **front** and **back-office** operations. Others are **salaried employees** , that get compensated **regardless** , whether they see patients or not. Overall, the clinic has **expanded** , and business **peaked 2 years ago** after a renovation, but since then **revenues** and **profitability** in certain areas have **declined** , which is a cause for **concern**.

Here are some of the questions that were raised as a result (subset presented for brevity) :

- Which of the four disciplines has declined in growth ? Is it worth carrying the lowest-grossing discipline?
- Is there any patient feedback from the web channel considered to improve services?
- Are the compensation models setup the way they should be?
- What is the single largest factor (or factors) causing a decline in revenues?
- Is 5.5 days a week of &quot;almost concurrent&quot; coverage right ? Should it be increased, or decreased to provide fully concurrent coverage?

The three examples illustrate what can transpire from a deep-dive into all the different factors that affect the profitability of a company, regardless of size. Once this kind of data-centric thinking can start happening, we can start looking at putting together a roadmap to get the organization to the level of technology maturity and data capability that would be essential to get started with analytics.

# ASSESSMENT OF TECHNOLOGY/DATA MATURITY LEVEL

Any Big Data initiative, regardless of the size of the business, will need to have a roadmap in place. Big Data capability is not something that can be achieved overnight, or even in a relatively short time span. The additional challenge with Big Data is that it can be quite difficult to attach an ROI to the effort. In the traditional landscape, these decisions are relatively simpler - spending, say, $500,000 on an effort that will ultimately result in improved profits, improved sales, or reduced costs amounting to more than $500,000 in the short term, or lower average returns per year attached to a continual benefit make it palatable to decision-makers. Big Data, on the other hand, may not give you any dollar benefit at all, to start with - what you might gain initially is just greater insight into your business. It will be up to you to push the envelope further, and seek the answers to questions that have probably not even taken shape yet. The Big Data effort should translate into a generalized platform that possesses the capability to do both - encourage you to ask the right question, and support you in getting the right answer.

Any such assessment for an organization&#39;s data capabilities needs to begin with an inventory process – does the organizational fully understand and comprehend where all the data is generated? Where it is coming from? Where it is stored? What purpose does it serve? How much storage is necessary? Is the storage onsite? Is it secure? As the organization starts gathering more data, have the necessary preparatory steps been taken? This does not necessarily need to boil down to the data element level to start with, but the organization needs to have a grasp of it&#39;s overall exposure to, and comfort with the amount of data being handled, and also be able to demonstrate a certain level of readiness to cope with what&#39;s coming as the amount of data increases. Following herewith are some examples of what more data can mean (sourced from [5])

As utility companies of all sizes start to use smart meters, they can better forecast load and reduce the need to build additional plants. But what are the data implications of smart meters? With a smart meter, a utility goes from collecting one data point a month per customer to receiving 3,000 data points for each customer each month, while smart meters send usage information up to four times an hour. One small Midwestern utility is using smart meter data to structure conservation programs that analyze existing usage to forecast future use, price usage based on demand and share that information with customers who might decide to forestall doing that load of wash until they can pay for it at the nonpeakprice.

A regional trucking company provides another example. Global position satellite technology now allows firms to track the trucks, the merchandise – practically anything you can attach an RFID tag to. How a company uses that information – to reroute trucks to create efficient routes, alert customers to deliveries, and forecast and price services – depends on the ability to manage and analyze dataeffectively.

Fast-growing, regional restaurant chains are also affected by big data. If you own one of these restaurants, what can you do about an onslaught of negative online reviews? Do you have the capacity to analyze the comments made about your restaurants on Facebook or Yelp? As the Economist Intelligence Unit report notes, &quot;Each time new kinds of data are born, so too are opportunities to learn from them, combine them with existing data and create new insights.&quot;

In another example, a health care consultancy has made the data coming out of medical practices the focus of its thriving business. The company collects billing and diagnostic code data from 10,000 doctors on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to create a virtual clinical integration model. The physician practices whose data is being collected have agreed to be measured against 90 standards of care guidelines. This allows the independent practices to meet Federal Trade Commission guidelines for negotiating with health plans. The consulting company analyzes the data to help the groups understand how well they are meeting the guidelines and whether they qualify for enhanced reimbursement based on offering a more cost-effective standard of care. It also sends them automated information to better take care of patients, like creating an automated outbound calling system for pediatric patients who were up to date on their vaccinations.

More and more companies like this one are building their business models on the analysis of data. So it&#39;s not just about running your business better with big data – in many cases, the data is the lifeblood of the organization. As a starting point, any SMB wishing to embark on this route must ask itself , &quot;Where am I today ?&quot;. This should translate into understanding if anything that can be done using retrospective data, instead of starting a data collection initiative from scratch. Also take the time to gauge the data – transactional, incidental, and behavioral (from transactions, events, and customer-centric, respectively). There is quite a bit of insight that can be gained by just looking at the data differently. In all the examples covered earlier – the clinic, the asset recovery company, and the food brokerage – there was **NO** additional data gathering that was required. Other SMBs can also go through a similar exercise and truly understand what their current maturity level is, and then start looking at other factors that affect profitability, and start sourcing out data related to those veryfactors.

# TECHNOLOGY and SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Big Data and analytics is not always a rosy proposition through and through – it comes with it&#39;s own challenges, in the form of analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy. Relational database management systems and desktop statistics and visualization packages often have difficulty handling big data. The work instead requires massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers, like Facebook does. What is considered &quot;big data&quot; varies depending on the capabilities of the users and their tools, and expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. Thus, what is considered &quot;big&quot; one year becomes ordinary later. For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration[2].It is up to you as an SMB owner to be able to assess what you consider as your &quot;tippingpoint&quot;.

Now, thanks to falling tech costs and new tools that display complex databases in ways even technophobes could love, smaller companies can unlock many more secrets from data. Your company&#39;s databases can be cross-referenced with the expanding galaxy of information drawn not just from the likes of social networks, government databases, and usage patterns on mobile devices, but also from increasingly specialized information sources such as digitized transcripts of call-center interactions and sensors sending updates from various steps within a supply chain, and do so affordably[4]. Companies ranging from established giants such as IBM, SAS, and Microsoft to startups such as Tranzlogic and Kaggle offer affordable, cloud-based data-crunching services-which can help you get nondigitized data into data-crunchable form-and today virtually anyone can get his or her hands dirty in the great Big Data mud pile. For starters, any SMB owner can look up these new players in the market - IBM&#39;s Watson Analytics (just ask Wayblazer and Cognitoys!), Google Analytics, InsightSquared, Canopy Labs, Tranzlogic and Qualtrics[6]. Look beyond the hype. If you do much research on big data, you&#39;re bound to run across a lot of articles on Hadoop. This new software framework for big data is getting a lot of attention, and it&#39;s a great technology, but it is not a realistic solution for SMBs. However, just because Hadoop isn&#39;t for you doesn&#39;t mean big data is irrelevant altogether. Consider what is best for your organizational growth before you invest purely based on price or hype[5].

One point to always remember - look for alternatives to SQL[3]. The pace of development and desire to avoid large capital investment at the early stages of adoption creates the need to use cloud computing. As a result, SMBs commonly rent virtual servers and put MySQL on top of it. The problem with this is that SQL systems traditionally were scaled with bigger and disproportionately expensive servers, but server instances available from public cloud usually have limited capacity. Look for databases that allow you to grow with your business. The market has diversified and, therefore, so should your database portfolio. To reduce capital expenditures associated

with this diversification, use a database as a service. However, if data needs to be kept on premises, free and/or open-source databases are another great alternative to avoid license fees and thus reduce upfront investment.

Once your organization does get to a point where you are starting to gather more data, you will find that the perceived &quot;value&quot; of your data is more. Suddenly you will find that the smallest nuances in the data can be useful to detect patterns or correlations. This ultimately means that the value of your data will be greater than the sum of it&#39;s parts, and may give you insight into your customers or your customers&#39; behavior. Data in this state, if stolen or misplaced, can represent significant value to someone else outside your organization, and worse, if compromised, can lead to legal complications. Even big companies like Target have been in the news lately for incidents of data breach, so no one is immune. Have the mindset that data is an asset, and treat it as such. As an SMB owner, familiarize yourself with regulations like PIPEDA, and understand and appreciate the role that the Privacy Commissioner plays in this regard. Many steps can be taken to even internally safeguard data, like de- identification of data once it lands within the confines of your company. For example, in the case of the asset recovery company, there is a lot of information that is shared by the collection agencies, down to even the SIN of the debtors, and one of the recommendations passed on was that none of this information be passed out to any of the field agents, since this is Personally Identifiable Information that should not fall into the wrong hands. So – be secure, be safe. You would not leave the keys to your house lying around, with an address tag in them – so why should an asset like data be treated any differently ?

# MEASURING VALUE and LOOKING AHEAD

After all is said and done, and having acknowledged that initial returns on any Big Data/Analytics venture can be spotty, an underlying question that any SMB owner is expected to ask is, &quot;How do I measure value gained from this exercise?&quot;, or, &quot;How can I decide if spending more money on expanding this venture is justified?&quot;. These are the same questions even asked in large corporations, and calculating value can be tricky. However, this is where being in the SMB space can work to your benefit. SMBs can adopt a more surgical approach, using big data and analytics to solve specific problems, and then scale up to tackle larger projects. If they don&#39;t have a good sense of what questions yield significant value for their business, they can&#39;t expect big data to magically provide solutions. As per the examples covered in &quot;Understanding The Business&quot;, you can go through a similar exercise and initially, at least, limit your scope to where there are actual dollars and cents involved. This would be all your spending, all your revenue generation points, and all the factors determining profitability. With all of this in hand, you should be able to map out the value of yourdata.

In somewhat generic terms, here are some (sample) considerations while you attempt to ascertain the value of your data, and the value of a Big Data initiative to your organization:

- Has the use of your data helped in increasing revenue? How andwhere?
- Has the use of your data helped in decreasing costs? How andwhere?
- After the use of Big Data, can you quantify your net salesuplift?
- Has the use of your data increased productivity, even if sales were to stay thesame?

One point to note, however, is that even if the answers to all the questions above are a resounding &quot;Yes&quot;, that does not necessarily mean that expanding your Big Data effort and gathering more data means more returns. More data only equates to more value if it gives you insight into your business. And finally, the rules of the &quot;Data Value Curve&quot; will apply – you will find yourself spending more time and money to store data, to get value. As time goes, you have to (and hopefully will be able to) calculate a point beyond which a scenario of diminishing returns applies. That would be an indicator of the optimal amount of data your organization needs to be able to maximize value out of it.

Looking ahead - This new big data world is not only about running problems faster, but about solving problems that were not solvable before. As data volumes grow and new data sources continue to multiply as well, what new big data problems do you have? When you put the right analytics to work on your big data problems, youcanstopthinkingofbigdataasonlyachallengeandstartseeingbigdataasanopportunity[5].ForSMBsthat

do manage to acquire consumer data, there&#39;s still more work to be done: They need to be sure to encourage employees to participate in thinking about how to use the information competitively[7].

BIG DATA and ANALYTICS is not a technological silver bullet that will solve all your problems and make your business more effective and productive overnight. It is a mindset that needs to start from the top, and everyone in the organization has to embrace it. The possibilities are endless – go forth and seek your own adventure!!
