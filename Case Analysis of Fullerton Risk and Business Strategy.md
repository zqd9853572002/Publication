# SUMMARY

Fullerton is a private non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India, its main business is providing loans to consumers and small enterprises in urban and rural India. Fullerton is supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Fullerton was founded in 2007 and experienced a booming development in the next two years, including initiated rural lending program (micro finance) in 2008. However, due to its majority of customers did not have credit history and the Indian consumer and commercial loan market's highly competitive nature, Fullerton's traditional loan underwriting standard flaws were exposed and faced the potential solvency risk and liquidity risk during the financial crisis. After that, Fullerton's business initiated several cost-cutting plans, started to target the under-served niche segments in rural/ urban business. In the niche segment, Fullerton's key competitors are public sector banks that do not use data analytics in any significant way, which might provide Fullerton a competitive advantage and opportunities for high-profit margins during normal business cycles.

With over 30 years of big consumer banking and regional international banks experience, as well as the risk management background and expertise, Mitra became Fullerton's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in 2010. Mitra believed that using data and analytics is critical for the future strategy of Fullerton's lending operation shift. Moreover, Mitra hopes to build a data-driven organization where data and analytics could guide strategy and decisions.

As a part of Fullerton's lending operation shifting strategy, Mitra believes adopting data and analytics could form a strong basis of credit issuance and loan pricing policy, then ensure the congruence between Fullerton's risk appetite and credit granting decision of risk exposure, which could finally benefit the Fullerton with optimal use of capital while meeting regulatory requirements.

In 2012, Mitra set up the risk analytics team headed by Chief Risk Officer (CRO). In early 2013, an experienced data analytics team under Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) and robust data analytic framework were established. Mitra wishes the data analytics team could model complex trade-offs in risk and return, especially in Balancing Loan Portfolio, Mixing Product and Geographical, and Designing Incentives and Managing the Implementation.

In building the data analytics driven organization, Mitra face lots of obstacles to the implementation. He is not sure whether Fullerton could use data and analytics in identifying profitable segments, setting appropriate interest rates, creating appropriate loan portfolios, changing operations and taking take advantage of the insights, and providing important information to stakeholders when they approve actions.

CAO and the data analytics team had proposed a business plan to Mitra, but they need to interpret the created data and justify that. They also need to develop a top-down decision-making process to determine the desired portfolio shape and then identify the profitable market segment to maximize profit while maintaining acceptable risk exposure. At last, the CAO and data analytics team need to re-design the incentive scheme and make it compatible with the risk analytics framework.


# IMPORTANT ISSUE

Due to most customers did not have credit history as well as the highly competitive nature of the Indian consumer and commercial loan market, Fullerton exposed its loan underwriting standard flaw and experienced the potential solvency risk and liquidity risk during the financial crisis. After years' investment with less return than expected, Temasek, Fullerton's parent company, would not like to provide more funds to Fullerton in the future unless Fullerton could achieve a higher valuation and risk-adjusted return by determining the portfolio shape and identify profitable product/ geographical market segments.

After serious consideration, Fullerton's management team, especially Mitra (CEO of Fullerton), believes some opportunities could solve the mentioned problems by introducing the data-based risk analytics strategy and re-targeting the segment market.

Fullerton had established an experienced data analytics team under CAO and related data analytics framework in 2013. Considering the main competitors, the public sector banks that served similar market segments with Fullerton, do not use data analytics in any significant way, the data analytics becomes a strategic asset as well as an opportunity that can increase business predictability and reduce loan loss. With data-based risk analytics in place, information asymmetry becomes an opportunity for Fullerton to differentiate itself from other competitors and to maintain sustainable competitive advantages.

In the general level, data analytics could help Fullerton to

- better targeting of customers, such as identifying good credit while avoiding bad credit;
- precisely get a trade-off between risk and reward, which could lead Fullerton to earn good profits while taking reasonable risks. For example, Fullerton could decide the loan interest pricing based on data and analytics, rather than based on potentially biased subjective criteria;
- strengthen the overall risk management infrastructure. For example, based on data analytics, the collection team was separated into 3 branches, and this brings greater efficiency and effectiveness while reducing Fullerton's own risk. Also, the fraud detection work get strengthened based on the data analytics;
- provide insight to the potential problems' root causes and quantify the business actions' effects, such as providing help in re-designing the agent and management incentive plan structures, and then guide the agents and region heads to perform &quot;correct&quot; behaviors.
- Although data analytics could provide lots of opportunity for Fullerton, the management team, especially Mitra, would like to know whether the data-driven based risk analytics could translate insights into actions and then drive business strategy, because this requires very difficult change in the whole organization, governance and incentive plan.

In more specific, Fullerton management team's major concern includes:

- Whether data and analytics could identify profitable segments and set interest rates that accurately accounted for the probability of default, especially in higher-risk segments;
- Whether data and analytics could be used to create a loan portfolio that offered acceptable returns during normal times and recession times.
- Whether Fullerton could make operation changes to its operations and decision making to gain the insight advantage from data and analytics
- And whether stakeholders could approve the actions taken based on data and analytics.


# CASE ANALYSIS

Based on the fact reflected in the article, to compete in the competitive market, Mitra re-target the niche market segment of newly emerging middle-class consumers, who were traditionally being neglected by the banking system and by micro-finance institutions. To deal with the problem of potential high default rate, Mitra realized the importance of the data analytics and initiated a set of data based risk analytics framework.

## Target Customer and Data-Driven Analytics Strategy

We agreed with Mitra's judgment on both target customers and the implementation of a data-driven analytics strategy.

### Niche Market Strategy

We believe the niche market strategy could bring Fullerton a competitive advantage in a specific market.

Fullerton could leverage its expertise in the specific area to stand out from the competition. Fullerton could provide tailored products or services based on customers' needs and serve a broader audience, which will eventually distinguish in the market.

A niche market often means less competition. The more specific/ tailored product and service, the less competition, and the harder the potential competitor to duplicate Fullerton's strategy. This could increase the potential advantage of Fullerton in this market.

Although newly-emerging middle-class consumers might lack good and enough credit history, the consumers received well education, have relative decent jobs and higher salary than average level, all of these could benefit in the future loan payment. Declining their loan request just because of lack of collateral and credit history is not wise for Fullerton. Fullerton could leverage its data analytics ability to identify the &quot;good risk&quot; among the customer group and develop different strategies and pricing structures for different risk-level people.

The niche market is a very specific kind of customer, and the sales revenue might be affected in the first months or years. However, if Fullerton could pay attention and invest money in this market continuously, as the times going, Fullerton could nurture the relationship with customers and gain future benefit. Combined with the customized product and service, Fullerton could better serve customers and further enhance the relationship with the customer and solidify customer loyalty.


### Data-Driven Analytics Strategy

We believe the data-driven analytics strategy is the foundation of Fullerton's niche market strategy

As mentioned in the article, as Fullerton's new targets move to newly emerging middle-class consumers, its key competitor becomes public sector banks. However, the good news for Fullerton is public sector banks generally do not use data analytics in their daily operation in any significant way. Considering Mitra had realized the importance of data analytics and initiated a set of data-based risk analytics framework, the competitor's weakness brings Fullerton a great advantage, although Fullerton still needs to deal with the problem of potential high default rate and lack of traditional data for ratemaking process.

Mitra initiated a set of Risk Analytics Framework to solve the problems. From the business perspective, the risk analytics framework includes a new credit evaluation system, which centralized the credit underwriting process and uses data analytics techniques in determining the appropriate rate for the customer (such as scorecard and behavior scorecard). This method could help Fullerton to occupy the niche market by quantitatively identifying the &quot;good risk&quot; and developing different marketing/ sales strategies and pricing structure accordingly. The risk analytics framework would be the core of the whole data-driven strategy.

As the niche market is mainly about newly-emerging middle-class consumers, it might be easier to gain the required data for risk evaluation and product/ service customization. Compared to the people who may obtain a loan easily with better and longer credit history, some people's priority is to obtain necessary money for future life or small business, so they might like to share required information with a financing company, like Fullerton. However, this definitely doesn't mean that data privacy is not important in Fullerton's whole operation chain.

As mentioned above, Fullerton could provide customized products and services to solidify customer loyalty. This means the company will transfer the company target from the internal target, such as a variety of business metrics, to customer need, which also calls for a high-involvement organizational structure. From the business side, this may need the sales and marketing department to know more about what customers want at different levels. The foundation of providing the customized product and service should also be data-based, instead of any subjective bias in marketing and sales.


## Risk Analytics Framework

In general, we agree with Fullerton's setup of the risk analytics framework and the strategy. However, some details need to be addressed and improved.


### Detailed Need to Be Improved

We agreed that the credit granting decision should be aligned with the risk appetite. However, Fullerton needs the risk criteria and key risk indicator (KRI) to connect these two parts, instead of using risk appetite to guide business decisions directly. Also, the KRI could provide alerts and prediction in advance for events will bring bad effect to Fullerton.

When setting the company's strategy and business plan, although Mitra was entrusted to design them to meet the overall goal, he should not write it only by himself in a vacuum. This might cause the organization cannot inherently align with strategy. To prepare the appropriate strategy and business plan, the employee should be involved in the preparation process before the post, this method could encourage consensus and involvement through the company.

To capture the risks and assess risk level, we agreed that Fullerton provides several parameters for assessment, such as the probability of default (PD), exposure at the time of default (EAD), and loss given default (LGD). However, we don't think using a logistic regression model to estimate PD/ LGD/ EAD with the historical loan and default data is appropriate. Because the logit regression should be used in the specific case level to judge the default possibility, instead of forecasting the aggregate effect (the aggregate effect is the sum of each case's effect). Moreover, because the coefficient estimates for these variables are obtained from the historical data, the estimate values might change as time going, so the coefficient will also get expired. Therefore, Fullerton might get some biased result at this step.

When dealing with the customer data, we do not see there is no part in the article describing the privacy concern and related operation process, however, privacy matter should be a very critical issue in the data-based decision-making organization. The privacy issues are involved with potential lawsuits, law, customer loyalty and trust, legal and regulatory framework as well as reputational risk. If there are any privacy issues, such as customer information, PII or related information leaked, Fullerton is likely to experience severe financial loss, including but not limited to stock price down, fine, investigation, and market share loss. Based on the importance of privacy and the potential outcome, we would like to address that when collecting data, Fullerton should only collect the information that the data owner approved for use, such as for credit approval. Also, Fullerton should not only adopt a risk control method to prevent any risk involved and store customer information in a safe place and delete when it is not necessary. During the data collection, Fullerton should avoid collecting identity number or other critical information which could identify the person if not necessary. Also, Fullerton should get permission when obtaining privacy information and keep the consent form if applicable.

We noticed Fullerton established an experienced data analytics team, but it seems the team is only composed by data scientist, that means no domain expert get involved. Although the team reports to CAO and further CRO, the team should get domain experts involved. The domain expert is a valuable person in dealing with practice and specific business.


### Risk Analytics Framework

When we look at the risk analytics framework in-depth, we could find Fullerton did well in Centralized Credit Underwriting, Application Scorecard and Behavior Scorecard and Risk-based Pricing in technique side and organizational structure side, but there are still some improvements available and further advanced ideas might be used in some point.


#### Centralized Credit Underwriting

We agreed Fullerton change the credit underwriting process from a decentralized approach to a centralized model. With the centralized model, the credit approval actions are managed by a team independently from the sales/ marking part. This will give the team more independence in deciding the final decision, regardless of the business side. In this way, approval authority was governed through objectively and carefully designed criteria and could be periodically reviewed by specific team authority. With this method, CRO, rather than branch manager, regional head, or other business side person, would be responsible for the credit approval quality and then take some responsibilities in deciding the financial result of Fullerton.

However, this method will also pose problems to Fullerton when providing with new flexible and tailored product and service. We would like to recommend Fullerton combined the human expertise and model result when dealing with the business that needs much more flexibility than the normal level or introduces a machine learning method in deciding the credit loan and price. From the company organizational structure side, because Fullerton has the Centralized Credit Underwriting process, the company could consider whether it should change its business organizational structure to network structure (matrix structure). With network structure, small business unit or autonomous unit, such as business branches in different areas, could loosely be jointed, but the company still control the core step, such as credit approval, rate, and condition determination. This structural change makes the autonomous units have more flexibility in business development and could provide the most effective service in different regions.


#### Application Scorecard and Behavior Scorecard

We agreed to use a scorecard to decide the applicant's qualification. As the article mentioned, after the semi-automated tool was introduced, the average approval/ rejection is significantly reduced, and the biased judgment results are also reduced.

The scorecard is a traditional concept in the loan business, however, with multiple newly gained attributes and the development of technology, it can provide help in making the decision. Fullerton could make the scorecard improved via a data-based risk analytics process, for example, it could automate the decision making accurately and efficiently, discover new relationships that were not obvious or found before, and even explore new sources of data.

In evaluating the existing customers' behavioral scorecard, the analytics team uses the behavioral attribute to alert and then prevent possible default action. This kind of dynamic exercise needs to continuously collect a large volume of customers' multi-dimensional data, including structured and unstructured data, which might propose some new problems for Fullerton in data governance and processing. At the same time, Fullerton also needs customer's approval in collecting and using these data.

But in general, we believe this method is a good idea in preventing the default, instead of just waiting for the incident to happen and then solve the problem.


#### Risk-Based Pricing

Fullerton adopts the Risk-based Pricing model in determining the appropriate interest rate and loan condition for individuals and businesses. As mentioned above, this method could set up the loan rate based on the specific risk posed by the customer's attributes, and this could also be useful in different segment markets or even in other industries, such as the UBI and telematics in the insurance industry.

We agreed with Fullerton to use this method because it can accept or reject risk by identifying the applicant's critical attributes and assign an appropriate interest rate in the segmented market without human intervention. This method considers the potential risk as well as the competition in the niche market. This means Fullerton could combine its risk appetite and sales revenue target at the practical level, and help the company achieve its bottom line and top line targets at the same time.


## Incentive and Implementation

As a part of Fullerton's building in an analytics-driven organization, designing incentives and managing implementation is also a critical part. Fullerton sets up separate intensive plans for field agents and regional heads. The field agent's intensive plan is more focused on the loan volume and closing deal number, while the regional head's intensive plan is mainly about average margin. This intensive plan might contradict the Centralized Credit Underwriting process mentioned above. Considering Fullerton already has the independently Centralized Credit Underwriting process in the back office, and CRO takes the responsibility of loan quality as well as the partial financial result, Fullerton could let the field agents and regional heads mainly take responsibility for developing business. This might facilitate the whole business improvement. However, to avoid the silo culture within the different departments, Fullerton could introduce other methods in dealing with the potential conflicts between the sales team and the risk management team. For example, for the new business region or unique business, Fullerton could establish a special project group to deal with a special situation. This is a way that Fullerton could change its vertical structure to a horizontal structure for a specific project. In the project group, front office person (from the business side), back office person (from risk management side), and necessary data analytics team could work together, and their goal becomes providing the unique working method to solve the problem, that means all people in the group will jump out from previous judging criteria and abandon their own insisted concept in their heads previously in some degree. The benefit of this kind of project group is it knows everything about the customer, so the customer experience would be much better, which would be extremely important in dealing with the problem in the niche market or even smaller market.

As mentioned in the article, using available data and the method of analyzing data are not new, moreover, other market competitors should also notice the newly-emerging middle-class segment market before Fullerton, but they didn't put lots of effort into that, this might be a big concern that needs Fullerton to pay special attention to. Based on this circumstance, we would like to remind that before implementing the data-driven risk analytics strategy and re-targeting the niche market, Fullerton should conduct market research, the main concern is about why other companies do not adopt the data-driven strategy, whether there are pitfalls on that, and why they do not invest in this niche market.

Based on the previous illustration, we do not believe what Fullerton doing now are low hanging fruits. Fullerton's action and strategy involve adopting data-driven risk analytics which needs the whole company to transfer their way of doing business, changing the current business process, and changing the organizational structure. All these might take a long time to complete, while short-term goals, such as sales revenue, might be affected. However, from the perspective of gaining more competitive advantages in the future, we believe Fullerton choose a good way in fulfilling its long-term goal and strategy at this moment.


# RECOMMENDATION

Although we believe Fullerton choose the correct method to fulfill its long-term goal and strategy, we still would like to propose some recommendations or changes that could better the process.

We separate our recommendations and suggestions into three parts: strategy, data collection and analysis, as well as organizational structure and incentive mechanisms.

## Strategy

As mentioned above, although Mitra was entrusted to design Fullerton's strategy to meet the overall goal, he should not do it only by himself. As we know, one person's strategy or vision could be another one's nightmare, if the strategy is set up by only one or few people, it could be very hard to be accepted by the whole company. To prepare the appropriate strategy and business plan that could be accepted by most of the people in the company, Mitra should let the employee be involved in the strategy-setting process. Also, obtaining the consensus within the management team would encourage the future implementation of the strategy.

As mentioned in the last part of Case Analysis, using data, analyzing data and newly-emerging middle-class segment market are not new to the whole market. There must be some reason that other competitors choose not to involve with that. Therefore, before Fullerton determines and implements the data-driven risk analytics strategy and re-targeting the niche market, it should conduct comprehensive market research, which will mainly focus on the competitors' research and industry panel and do the risk-return analysis on this issue. Fullerton could determine its future strategy and market based on the research and related data.

Fullerton is supervised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which means its risk management structure needs to meet the specific requirements, although some specific criteria might be different from bank institutions. As mentioned above, Fullerton should set up risk criteria as well as the key risk indicator (KRI), instead of the risk appetite in general, to indicate how to perform in the daily work. The KRI could help Fullerton to drill down from the top risk to the specific case level, which could be easier to find the detailed questions. Also, Fullerton could set up KRI based on data to monitor potential risk event and develop methods to prevent loss/ risk (including human intervention method) in advance.


## Data Collection and Analysis

Considering Fullerton re-targets its market to the middle-class consumer, and this group is lacking a good and enough credit history from the official bureau, Fullerton could obtain data from other sources, such as from data brokers. Data brokers collect information from online and offline sources and combine them together, and then sell to the company in need. Fullerton could use a data broker to collect the required information for loan approval, such as data in social media, web browsing history, online/ offline purchase history, driver's license and motor vehicle records, marriage status, travel history, insurance purchasing history, etc. Through data mining, Fullerton could discover relationships between the information and related risk. However, the highly proceed data is expensive, buying this kind of data from a data broker might generate an adverse effect on Fullerton's financial condition, therefore, Fullerton should trade-off between buying proceed data and buying raw data and conduct ETL by itself, also, Fullerton should conduct related market and financial research in selecting appropriate data broker and purchasing. As the collected data become more and comprehensive, Fullerton could consider to build up its own independent social credit score system and it could connect with different data sources. However, Fullerton should consider the problem of cost, including human resource cost and financial cost, in accessing different data resources and necessarily internal effort and improvement.

When dealing with customer data, Fullerton should pay special attention to the data privacy issue. For example, when collecting data, Fullerton should only collect the required information for credit approval and risk control effort, store it followed data privacy protocol, and delete data when not necessary for further use. Moreover, in the data collection process, Fullerton should avoid identifying the person based on data. Fullerton should also obtain the customer's permission before access private information.

Considering there are too much data from different sources, and its volume, velocity, variety will increase quickly. Also, the dynamic exercise needs continuously analyze multi-dimensional customers' actions and behavior, which need fast speed in data collection and processing. Therefore, Fullerton needs to consider developing its own infrastructure to organize data.

To capture the risks and assess risk levels, Fullerton uses historical data and logistic regression to predict the potential default action or possibility. We suggest to make the prediction at the case level, rather than on the overall level (aggregate effect), then it could be much more precise. Also, due to the historical data will be outdated, and the potential fraud loan application evolving (potential fraudsters constantly change their tactics and target), therefore the predictive model will be outdated as well and the variables' coefficient estimate also get expired, Fullerton could consider the new method to identify the new trend, such as using cluster analysis for the model.

As mentioned above, Fullerton should arrange domain experts in the data-based risk analytics team. Domain experts understand the data generation process and the business objective, they can also provide help in asking the right questions and communicating effectively to the decision-makers by &quot;talking their language&quot;. Moreover, domain experts also know how to use relevant criteria to measure the predictive model, which would be very useful when comparing different models' qualities and results.

For some specific program or business, to avoid any time delay in making decisions and then the loss of potential business opportunity, we recommend Fullerton adopt self serve analytics to some degree. In the highly competitive market, if risk analytics tasks or underwriting functions are extremely strictly limited in the back office, the work group might not be able to leverage the power of analytics. Self-service analytics empowers the business users to do their tasks themselves and provide the work group real-time answer. With the help of self serve analytics, the work group could explore data and find the answer by themselves. However, the self serve analytics also need training, through which the employee knows how to turn the strength into a benefit in practice and know the related risks of using the self serve analytics. We also recommend arranging data experts and business experts in the team when using the self serve analytics, to solve potential technical and business risk problems.

## Organizational Structure and Incentive Mechanisms

Considering Fullerton already build the independently Centralized Credit Underwriting process, we suggest Fullerton could arrange its business development only to oversee the business side, instead of considering sales revenue and profit at the same time. This means Fullerton might change its organizational structure and incentive plan. Moreover, based on the independently Centralized Credit Underwriting, we also suggest Fullerton could consider the network structure, in which small business units could work flexibly, while Fullerton can still control the core business decision and bottom line.

However, for some specific programs or businesses, to avoid silo culture, we recommend Fullerton to form a special project group to deal with a specific problem, and team members in the group provide special support to solve the problem.

# CONCLUSION

After the 2008 financial crisis, due to internal and external factors, Fullerton was exposed to significant risk in its business operation and survival. Fortunately, Mitra, the new CEO of Fullerton, initiates multiple plans to reverse the current situation, the main two strategies are the data-based risk analytics strategy and re-target the customer to the newly emerging middle-class consumers' niche market. To pursue the two strategies, Mitra and other management teams, such as CRO and CAO, initiated the risk analytics framework (includes Centralized Credit Underwriting, Application Scorecard, and Behavior Scorecard and Risk-based Pricing) to make sure the company could earn appropriate profit, take the reasonable risk and meet company's risk appetite. To make the company implement the strategy smoother, Fullerton also initiates the necessary change toward organizational structure and incentive plan.

We reviewed Fullerton's plan and analyze the case thoroughly. Based on the description in the article, we also propose some suggestions and recommendations to Fullerton (especially on the issue of Strategy outline, Data collection and analysis, and organizational structure and incentive mechanisms), that might better the plan and strategy implementation. Although Fullerton's plan needs to be improved at some points, we still believe that its strategies are good and could bring the company a good future by the method of data-based decision making.
